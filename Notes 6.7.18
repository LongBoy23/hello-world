Write a function that takes a vector (use a list) and a scalar and returns the scalar/vector multiplication
Basically, if x exists in C, a exists in C^m --> Compute xa
DOCUMENTATION _ 
def vector_mult(vector,scalar):
  b =[]
  for x in vector:
    b.append(scalar*x)
  return b
  
vector = [1,2,3]
scalar = 42
print(vector_mult(vector,scalar))

Write a function that takes 2 vectors as arguments and returns their sum
DOCUMENTATION _
# (vect1,vect2) -> vect3
# We assume our two vectors to have the same length
def Sum2Vectors(vect1, vect2):
  # initialized vector to hold sums
  sumVector = []
  # defined the length of both vectors using vect1
  length = len(vect1)
  # iterate through a range [0 , length-1]
  for index in range(length):
    # Store sum of vect1 and vect2 at same index
    indexSum = vect1[index] + vect2[index]
    # Append index sum to sumVector
    sumVector.append(indexSum)

  return sumVector

vector1 = [1,2,3,4]
vector2 = [23,21,87,1738]

print(Sum2Vectors(vector1,vector2))
