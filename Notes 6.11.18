Orthongonal Vectors
if  x = [[a+bi],[c-di]]

def a pair of vectors x,y are orthogonal if x*y = 0 or equivalently y*x = 0
  a pair of sets X and Y are orthogonal if for all x [epsilon] X , y [epsilon] Y 
  
Norm of vector
A vector x is said to be normal if ||x|| = 1

A set of non zero vectors is called orthonormal if for x,xj exists in s xi*xj = 0 if i(x=)j and xi*xj = 1 if i = j

let there be a set of orthogonal vectors. now let r be an arbitrary vector of compatible dimesions. where r is orthogonal to our set of vectors

NormsL A vector norm is a function from a set V to the non-negative real numbers ||x||:V---> RR+

Norm Axioms:
  1. Norm of X is greater than or equal to zero and the norm is zero iff x = 0
  2.||x+y|| is lessthan or equal to ||x||+||y||
  3. if a is a scalar ||ax||=|a|||x||
